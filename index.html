          <li>CSS Rule is to start with a selector and then in brackets add properties and their values. such as div {color: blue;}</li>
          <li>Margins are the area on the outside of an element and padding is a margin inside an element</li>
          <li>In CSS as a selector, * is used to select all elements to have what is stated in the declaration</li>

          <li>In img selector "display" property can get the "block" value to assign each image to start on a new line</li>
          <li>Using ul selector can adjust padding and font-size properties</li>
          <li>"header" and "footer" selectors can be altered with "width", "height", "background color", and "color" properties</li>
          <li>"p" selector can be altered by "text-align" and "font-size" properties</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a beginner friendly coding language thats compact and flexible</li>
          <li>JavaScript can create HTML and setting CSS style and generate graphics 2D and 3D</li>
          <li>JavaScript is a loosely typed and dynamic language. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types.</li>
          <li>variables are named containers that store data in the code</li>
          <li>String is a 'string' of text not meant to be code like this sentence</li>
          <li>Boolean is a true false statement</li>
          <li>Array is a structure that stores multiple values in a single reference</li>
          <li>Objects are everything I type in JavaScript and can be stored and used</li>
          <li>Operators are mathematical symbols that produce a result on two values</li>
          <li>Addition with the '+' sign can add numbers or combine strings</li>
          <li>Subtraction, Multiplication, and division act as intended with numbers</li>
          <li>Assignment assigns a value to a variable using the '=' sign</li>
          <li>Strict Equality performs a test to see if two values are equal and uses Boolean answers</li>
          <li>When I put the 'Not' operator (!) before a value it returns the opposite of what its in front of</li>
          <li>'Not' can be used with the Strict Equality to make 'Does not equal' (!==) so the value will be asked that question</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures that test if an expression returns true or not (if...else statements etc)</li>
          <li>Functions are actions I want to reuse without repeating myself</li>
          <li>Events are interactions with the webiste on the front end and require 'Event Handlers'</li>
          <li>Primitive Values are values that aren't objects</li>
          <li>String type is a 'string' of text not meant to be code like this sentence</li>
          <li>Boolean type is a true false statement</li>
          <li>Undefined type has not been assigned a value</li>
          <li>Null type has one value and that is non-existant</li>
          <li>Numeric types is defined as  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures">such</a>; it is very long and has lots of numbers</li>
          <li>Objects are everything I type in JavaScript and can be stored and used</li>
          <li>Array type is a structure that stores multiple values in a single reference</li>
          <li>Array Indexes are zero-indexed and sequential</li>
          <li>A Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property, also called 'atoms'</li>
          <li>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a data-interchange format. Although not a strict subset, JSON closely resembles a subset of JavaScript syntax. Though many programming languages support JSON, it is especially useful for JavaScript-based apps, including websites and browser extensions.</li>
          <li>A JavaScript method is a property of an object that contains a function definition</li>
          <li>The arguments is an object which is local to a function</li>
          <li>'src' is the source file location for an external file</li>
          <li>In order to link JavaScript files to another file use this script: <xmp><script src="<file-location-here"></script></xmp></li>
          <li>Loops are lines of code that repeat basic and predictable tasks such as printing each value in an array index</li>
          <li>A 'for loop' uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. I can stop the loop using another statement</li>
          <li>'For loops' have 3 important statements:</li>
          <ol>
            <li>A starting point in the array</li>
            <li>A condition to be met to stop the loop</li>
            <li>A predictable pattern for the loop to follow</li></ol>
          <li>Example of a 'for loop':
              <xmp>for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) {
                console.log(shapes[x]);
               }</xmp></ol>
          <li>Math functions can help randomize result values in a array index</li>
