# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was made by myself to outline and list different skills, terms, and tasks I need to be able to complete. All of these items are things I have learned during these Prework modules.

## Usage

I can use this study guide to help myself choose what to study first. All I have to do is right click the page and select "Inspect Element" to open up the Dev Tools on my browser. Then click "Console" on the tab list. It will then display a list of topics to study and at the bottom it will randomly select a topic as a suggestion for studying.
